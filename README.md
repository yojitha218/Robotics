# Robotics Delivery Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of a delivery system with four colored robots navigating to target bases, developed using PyBullet. Created during my Btech. in Computer Science (Specialization in AI) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University, this project showcases my skills in Python programming and robotics simulation.

## Project Overview

The Robotics Delivery Simulation features four robots (Green, Red, Blue, Yellow) that autonomously navigate a 2D environment to deliver packages to corresponding colored bases while avoiding obstacles. All functionality is implemented in a single Python file, with visualizations of robot paths and delivery timelines.

- **Technologies**: Python, PyBullet, Matplotlib, NumPy
- **Features**:
  - Autonomous navigation for four robots to user-specified target bases.
  - Obstacle avoidance using proximity-based detection.
  - Visualized robot trajectories with Matplotlib, including markers (e.g., circles, 'x') for stops.
  - Precise positioning with logged delivery status.
- **File**: `robotics_simulation.py`

## Getting Started

To run the simulation:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pybullet matplotlib numpy
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python robotics_simulation.py
   ```
3. Follow prompts to specify robot paths (e.g., "Green robot to Blue base").

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- PyBullet, Matplotlib, NumPy
- A system with GUI support for PyBullet visualization
